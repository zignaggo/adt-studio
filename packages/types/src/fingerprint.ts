/**
 * Pipeline fingerprint — "the contract" for splitting a book into page-range
 * parts and merging them back.
 *
 * Page ids are deterministic and absolute (`pg051`, or `pg051052` in spread
 * mode), so per-page data from a part is portable into the full book with no
 * id remapping — *provided* both books were extracted from the same PDF with
 * the same extraction-affecting config. The fingerprint is what two machines
 * compute independently to prove that.
 *
 * Two tiers, enforced differently at merge time:
 *
 * - IDENTITY (`identityHash`) — PDF bytes, DB schema, and the config fields
 *   that change extraction output (and therefore page ids). A mismatch means
 *   the pages don't line up; merge must HARD-FAIL.
 * - SEMANTICS (`semanticsHash`) — the per-page prompt/param/model subset and
 *   editing language. A mismatch means pages were processed with different
 *   instructions but still line up structurally; merge WARNS and lets the
 *   coordinator override.
 *
 * Book-level prompt fields (glossary, quiz, toc, summary, speech) are
 * deliberately absent: parts never emit book-level data, and merge always
 * re-runs the book-level stages on the assembled book.
 */

/**
 * Config fields that change extraction output (page ids, page text,
 * positioned text). Any mismatch makes a part's per-page data incompatible
 * with the target book.
 *
 * `start_page` / `end_page` are intentionally NOT here — they define the part
 * window and must not affect the fingerprint. That exclusion is the whole
 * point of the contract.

 * per-page output is copied in and never re-run. Each `StepConfig`-shaped entry
 * carries its own `model`/`temperature`, so these keys capture model and prompt
 * drift together. A mismatch does not break page-id alignment.
 *
 * Downstream stages (captions, translate, …) are deliberately EXCLUDED: the
 * merge clears and re-runs them on the assembled book, so their config drift is
 * irrelevant to merge safety — and including them produced false positives,
 * since the coordinator's shell never sets them (e.g. a contributor running
 * captions materializes `image_captioning_grade_level` the shell lacks).
